📘 Intelligent Study Focus Assistant

A smart system to help students stay focused by detecting mobile distractions and triggering motivational audio.

📌 Overview

During my semester exam preparation, I often found myself getting distracted whenever my mobile phone was nearby or when notifications appeared. This personal challenge inspired me to build the Intelligent Study Focus Assistant — a system that detects mobile phone presence or usage during study time and instantly plays a motivational audio clip to refocus the student.

This project is designed for anyone who struggles with staying focused while studying and wants to build healthier, distraction-free habits.
